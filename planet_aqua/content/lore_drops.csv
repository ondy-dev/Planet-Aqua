awakening_2,awakening,2,"The Ocean's Song Changes","The ancient song of the ocean has changed in recent years. Where once it was a harmonious melody, it now carries notes of sadness and warning. The ocean scholars believe this is the ocean's way of communicating its distress. Some fish-people claim they can understand the lyrics, but their translations are often contradictory."
awakening_3,awakening,3,"The Synthetic Material Ban","The Council has implemented a partial ban on synthetic materials, but the enforcement is inconsistent. Some floating cities have become havens for synthetic material smugglers, while others have embraced the ban wholeheartedly. The black market for synthetic materials is booming, with prices reaching astronomical levels."
awakening_4,awakening,2,"The Great Migration","A massive migration of marine life has begun, with entire species moving to cleaner waters. The fishing guilds are struggling to adapt to the changing patterns, while the Tide-Walkers see it as a sign that the ocean is trying to heal itself. The migration has created new opportunities for trade but also new conflicts over fishing rights."
awakening_5,awakening,3,"The Ocean's Memory","The ocean scholars have discovered that the ocean has a kind of memory, storing information about past events in its currents and tides. By studying these patterns, they can predict future environmental changes. However, the ocean's memory is also storing the pain of pollution, and some scholars worry that this collective trauma is affecting the entire ecosystem."
transformation_1,transformation,2,"The Circular Economy Revolution","A new economic system has emerged where nothing is wasted and everything is reused. The floating cities have become self-sufficient, with each city specializing in different aspects of the circular economy. The system is so efficient that some cities have started exporting their excess resources to other water-worlds."
transformation_2,transformation,3,"The Ocean's Healing","The ocean is beginning to show signs of healing. The water is clearer, the fish are returning, and the coral reefs are growing back. The ocean scholars attribute this to the combined efforts of all generations working together. It's a slow process, but it's working. The ocean's song is becoming more hopeful again."
transformation_3,transformation,2,"The New Generation's Optimism","The young fish-people are more optimistic about the future than any previous generation.
