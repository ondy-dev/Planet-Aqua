# Planet Aqua â€” Stop the Trash Tide

ðŸŒŠ A meaningful simulation game about ocean plastic pollution and sustainable fishing

## Overview

Planet Aqua is a generational simulation game where you play as the **Ocean Guardian**, chosen by the Council of Depths to lead this water-world. Each generation of fish-people lives for 5 years, and you must guide Planet Aqua through 30 generations (150 years) of challenges.

The game is presented as **The Ocean Guardian's Diary**, chronicling your decisions and their consequences across the ages. Each diary entry represents 5 years of your guardianship, with rich lore about the floating cities, fishing guilds, and the mysterious depths.

The game features **34 evidence-based actions** ranging from simple plastic bag bans ($25) to complex global treaties ($320), each with realistic trade-offs and public opinion impacts. You'll learn which real-world solutions actually work through trial and error, with actions grounded in the latest ocean plastic pollution research.

As Ocean Guardian, you must balance the needs of the people, the economy, and the ocean's health. The fate of an entire world rests in your hands...

The game teaches systems thinking: how values, technology, and choices compound into long-term consequences across generations.

## World-Building & Lore

Planet Aqua is a water-world where you serve as the **Ocean Guardian**, chosen by the **Council of Depths** to lead the floating settlements. The world features:

- **Floating Cities**: Settlements built on the ocean surface
- **Fishing Guilds**: Powerful organizations that control the fishing industry
- **Tide-Walkers**: Citizens who live on the coastlines and beaches
- **Ocean Scholars**: Scientists who study the depths and currents
- **The Great Garbage Vortex**: A massive accumulation of waste in the ocean currents
- **The Council of Depths**: The governing body that oversees the ocean's health

The game's events and actions are framed within this rich, immersive world where every decision affects the delicate balance between civilization and the ocean's health.

## Research Alignment

This game is grounded in real-world research about the **Great Pacific Garbage Patch** and ocean plastic pollution, incorporating findings from the latest scientific studies:

- **Fishing Gear Focus**: A large share of floating macroplastic in Earth's garbage patches comes from fishing-related gear, which is reflected in the game's events and mechanics
- **Recycling Reality**: Only 9% of plastic waste is actually recycled globally - the game reflects this harsh reality
- **Regional Differences**: China produces 32% of global plastics, while the US consumes 130kg per person annually (highest globally)
- **Cleanup Effectiveness**: Research shows that 80% cleanup can bring pollution to safe levels for marine life
- **Upstream Prevention**: Prevention at the source is far more effective than downstream cleanup efforts
- **Systems Thinking**: Emphasizes how convenience culture, industrial practices, and weak governance create complex environmental problems
- **Trade-offs**: Teaches the balance between short-term production and long-term ecosystem health
- **Unintended Consequences**: Shows how well-intentioned actions can have unexpected environmental impacts

### Academic Frameworks

The game incorporates several key concepts from environmental studies and systems thinking:

- **Development = Values + Technology + Consequences**: Every decision reflects underlying values, uses available technology, and produces measurable outcomes
- **Unintended Consequences**: Actions often have effects beyond their immediate purpose
- **Liberation vs Control**: Balancing economic freedom with environmental protection
- **Technological Determinism**: How technology choices shape environmental outcomes
- **Medium is the Message**: The game itself teaches through its mechanics, not just its content

## Game Mechanics

### Core Stats
- **Year**: Current game year (0-150)
- **Money**: Economic resources for taking actions (starts at $100) - **Strategic Resource Management Required**
- **Ocean Toxicity**: Total ocean pollution level (0-100%, game over at 100%)
- **Fish Health**: Marine ecosystem health (0-100%, game over at 0%)
