The once-teeming waters of Planet Aqua have been emptied of life. Your failure to protect
the marine ecosystem has led to the collapse of the food chain. The fishing villages
have been abandoned, the economy has crumbled, and the ocean's song has been silenced.

The Council of Depths has stripped you of your title. You are remembered only as
the Guardian who let the ocean die. The Great Garbage Vortex continues to grow,
a monument to your failed stewardship.

The currents whisper your name in shame...

Your negligence has allowed the ocean to become so polluted that it can no longer

they touch. The very essence of your world has been corrupted.

The Council of Depths has banished you to the deepest trenches. You watch from
the abyss as the surface world struggles to survive in a poisoned ocean.

You watch from exile as the new leaders struggle to undo the damage of your
failed reign. The ocean's fate now rests in the hands of those you failed to serve.

your praises, and the people tell stories of your wisdom.
